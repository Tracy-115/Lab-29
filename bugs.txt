bug 1
I had an extra dummy code at the bottom
Fix: I removed the whole thing

bug 2
I couldn't open the tasks.txt, and when I was able to opne it
fix: there was no tasks.txt, because I might have not saved it so I had to create a new one 

bug 3
After tasks were given, it didn't move to procesing
fix: I added more codes to my function, so that if in one time, the person is given the task, the next time they will be moved to processing

bug 3
After the tasks were being processed, they didn't move to complete
fix: I added a similar code to my function again. (Similar with the processing part) It have a random in it so that it immitates real life tasks. 

bug 4
the rand did not work 
fix: added #include <cstdlib> and #include <ctime>

bug 5
I called workForTheDay with (employees, 20, 20) which did not work 
Fix: changed it to workForTheDay(employees, 20(or an integer)) because this function only allowed one integer

bug 6
My code didn't start from time 1
tried fixing: i tried different loops, while, and for, and also checked the loops to see if I missed out on anything

bug 7
i didn't get the 50% chance like I wanted
fixed: the code had rand()%3 and I changed it to rand()%2

bug 8 
rand generator had the same numbers each time
fixed: i forgot to add srand(time(0))

bug 9
there was no code to fix the if statements
fix: I added else if and else statements so that if one code did not went through, it can still have other statements to go through and finally printing the else statements

bug 10
there were many times I had a typo with lista 
fix: I went through the code and changed every list to lista

bug 11
I also wanted to print the task the employees were working on, but after the first loop, the program stopped printing
FixL: I realized that because I added the string task after popping the value, it was not carried onto the task, thus I moved string task to the start of the loop so that the value lasts until the printing part
