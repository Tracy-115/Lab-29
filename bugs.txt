bug 1
I had an extra dummy code at the bottom
Fix: I removed the whole thing

bug 2
I couldn't open the tasks.txt, and when I was able to opne it
fix: there was no tasks.txt, because I might have not saved it so I had to create a new one 

bug 3
After tasks were given, it didn't move to procesing
fix: I added more codes to my function, so that if in one time, the person is given the task, the next time they will be moved to processing

bug 3
After the tasks were being processed, they didn't move to complete
fix: I added a similar code to my function again. (Similar with the processing part) It have a random in it so that it immitates real life tasks. 

bug 4
the rand did not work 
fix: added #include <cstdlib> and #include <ctime>

bug 5
I called workForTheDay with (employees, 20, 20) which did not work 
Fix: changed it to workForTheDay(employees, 20(or an integer)) because this function only allowed one integer
