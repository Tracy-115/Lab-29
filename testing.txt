Hello Professor, I did this 2 days ago, and for some reason, everything I wrote disappeared and maybe because I didn't save it, but I can assure you that I did it before the deadline. 

The function I will be testing on is workForTheDay().
In my testing, I will have a file with multiple employees and multiple assignments. 
Initially, they will be assigned to one task each, and then, after each time, it will move along assigned -> progress -> completed
My driver program is going to use my dummy program from lab 29. 

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <map>
#include <array>
#include <list>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
void workForTheDay(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>>& employees, int Time);
int main(){
    map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> dummy;
    dummy ["Lily"][0].push_back("Task 1: Mopping the floor");
    dummy ["Lily"][1].push_back("Task 2: Opening Doors and Windows");
    dummy ["Lily"][2].push_back("Task 3: Checking to see if there were any overnight orders");

    workForTheDay(dummy, 5);
    return 0;
}
